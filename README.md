This repository serves to showcase an analysis for the Virginia Beach Police Department for the first half of years 2021, 2022 and 2023 along with a Max, min, mean and One standard deviation of the results for 2023.

There is more work to do with this database as I found it to be interesting the way crime is reported.

Futurue challenges include adding google maps API and cleaning up the addresses to create a map in Tableau.
