Virginia Beach Police Department Crime Analysis
Overview
Welcome to the Virginia Beach Police Department Crime Analysis repository! This project is dedicated to showcasing an in-depth analysis of crime data for the first half of the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The primary goal is to provide insights into the patterns and trends of criminal activities in Virginia Beach during this time period. Police_Incident_Reports.zip is the CSV file used which is too big to upload to GH without compression.

Analysis Highlights
The repository includes a detailed examination of various crime metrics, focusing on key statistical measures such as maximum (Max), minimum (Min), mean, and one standard deviation for the year 2023. These metrics offer a comprehensive overview of the crime data distribution, aiding in the identification of outliers and trends.

Current Status
As of the latest update by the repository owner (D. E.), the analysis has successfully covered the specified time frame. However, it's essential to note that this project is an ongoing effort, and there is more work to be done. The exploration of the crime database has revealed intriguing insights into the reporting dynamics, prompting further investigation and refinement.

Future Enhancements
1. Google Maps API Integration
One of the exciting future challenges is the integration of the Google Maps API. By incorporating this feature, users will be able to visualize crime hotspots and trends geographically. This addition will enhance the overall understanding of crime distribution across Virginia Beach and provide a more interactive and user-friendly experience.

2. Address Data Cleanup for Tableau Mapping
Improving the quality of address data is another key focus for future development. Cleaning up the addresses will facilitate the creation of a comprehensive crime map using Tableau. This visual representation will offer an intuitive and informative way to explore crime patterns, aiding both researchers and the general public in understanding the local crime landscape.
